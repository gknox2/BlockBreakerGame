For my gallery I am submitting a screen recording that showcases the gameplay and some of the features. I am also submitting a screenshot of the game being played from a seperate angle. I think it looks visually appealing with the colors of the blocks being based off of their health, the stars flying past the player, and the space themed skybox.
