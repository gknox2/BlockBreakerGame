Brief explanation of what I did: I also detailed it in comments
I started by creating a array list grid using a double for loop, this way I can access each specific position that a block could 
be in. Then I used a difficulty function to fill the top row of the grid with blocks to start the game. The blocks and balls I created
as GrObjects in the blockobjects.js script. I used event listeners to allow the user to aim and shoot balls. After all of the balls have
left the gameplay area, the round is incremented and states are changed. Then the blocks are moved down a row and new blocks are created 
in the first row. If a block reaches the last row, the game is over. I was unable to create a gameover screen like I had wanted to. Instead,
the animate function just stops updating and the browser needs to be reloaded to play again.
